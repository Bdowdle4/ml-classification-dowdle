    "**Objective:** This project will demonstrate my ability to apply classification modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. I will:  \n",
    "- Load and explore a dataset.\n",
    "- Analyze feature distributions and consider feature selection.\n",
    "- Train and evaluate a classification model.\n",
    "- Compare different classification approaches.\n",
    "- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- Conduct a peer review of a classmateâ€™s project. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project uses the UCI Banknote Authentication Dataset to detect fake banknotes based on features such as Variance, Skewness, Curtosis. The goal is to predict which notes are genuine/fake. I will create a Random Forest model, split/train the data, evaluate performance using key metrics, and create visualizations to interpret the results.\n",
